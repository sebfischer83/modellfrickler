I had some problems with the Sch√ºrzen, maybe I had to test more the fitting of the parts before gluing all the stuff. The rest was a really nice, uncomplicated build.
Then I try for the first time a winter camo with whitewash. Perhaps I remove too much white color (washable white color works nicely) but so it looks very worn out. Then I try oil dot weathering and on this color it works really well and give many subtle changes in the underlying color.

The Vallejo snow products works really well for me. I want to put it on a diorama, but I don't know if it really happens.

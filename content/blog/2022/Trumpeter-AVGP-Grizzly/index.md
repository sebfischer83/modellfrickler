The build was not so hard except the build of the turret, here they print 2 times the same step and missed the main part.
But the forgotten instructions can be found here on [Cybermodeler](https://www.cybermodeler.com/hobby/builds/tru/build_tru_1502.shtml).
I tried this time to build the white UN variant. Maybe I used the wrong white (Revell Aqua Color) because the coat went far too thick. Furthermore, it's hard to correct any error on white paint, I tried ocher pigments, and it doesn't end well. Next I tried to put some leaves and this seems good but overall, I don't really like the outcome of this model, but it was a good learning, though.

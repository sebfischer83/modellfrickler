After reading a lot about chipping with chipping fluids and many tries, I thought it's impossible to do it without airbrush.
But somewhere in the internet (sorry I forgot about the source) I found a clue about the problem with my tries.
The solution was, I must use an acrylic paint that is based on alcohol for the top coat, for me, it was Tamiya that works best.
The steps for me are:
1. paint with AK Primer Rust and let it dry 1 day
2. paint a coat with AK Dark Rust and wait 1 day
3. paint a coat of AK Heavy Chipping Fluid and wait 15-30min until it seems to be dry
4. paint the top coat with Tamiya color with thinning ratio of 50:50, I needed 3 layers painted after 10 min the other
5. with a wet brush, bring water onto the model and 1-2 minutes and start chipping with a stiff brush or something similiar
You can see the results here.
